The run_analysis.R file will go through the 5 steps asked:

1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This as the assignment given in the Coursera Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data in R"


For the proyect we use some  data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone that where given to us.

We try to keep the original concepts of the data frames so we didn't mis them a lot. We just change x for a and y for y. We create some data frames form the data given with some intuitive names.
